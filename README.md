This repo contains all of my R&D for the Mission Science Workshop dedicated to the robotics summer class.

## 🔧 Project Overview

The project involved both hardware and software components:
- **CAD Models**: Custom-designed 3D parts modeled in SolidWorks, including chassis pieces and motor attachments.
- **Code**: Arduino-based programs to control the ESP32 RC car's movement and sensor inputs.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `CAD Models/` — Contains SolidWorks part files (`.SLDPRT`) used to 3D print the body and components of the car.
- `Code/` — Includes `.ino` files programmed with the Arduino IDE to control the car's behavior.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of the Mission Science Workshop summer program, which empowers students to build, experiment, and learn through real-world science and engineering challenges.

## 🚗 About the RC Car

The RC car uses:
- An ESP32 microcontroller
- L298N Motor Controller
- TT motors and custom motor mounts
- connect to 192.168.4.1

- 3D-printed components designed from scratch
- Remote control via WIFI
